# Welcome to Part 3: Introduction to R Studio, the third act of Lab Meeting 3. 
# If you haven't done any coding before, well, you're in for a ride! R is a language designed by statisticians so that researchers can run complex statistical analyses
# on their personal computers. It is open source, although there is a paid version. This is a very useful skill in the life and biomedical sciences, and someone who
# can process data and perform even the simplest graphical summaries using R can get a job as a Data Analyst. 


rm(list=ls(all=TRUE)) # This line of code removes traces of codes that were ran on the ongoing session. 

setwd("G:/RCodes/CH2") #Set your directory folder. This is just an example, you need to figure out the path to your directory folder, which is unique to your computer. 

#Import data set
